# Mobile Money USSD Simulator

A Python-based simulation of MTN/Airtel-style USSD mobile money transactions using structured programming principles and later Object Oriented Programming.

## 📋 Overview

This program mimics the core functionality of mobile money USSD services (like MTN's *165# or Airtel's *185#) through a text-based interface. It demonstrates key programming concepts while simulating real-world financial transactions.

## ✨ Features

- **💰 Send Money**: Transfer funds to other phone numbers
- **🏦 Deposit Money**: Add funds to your account
- **💵 Withdraw Money**: Cash out through agents
- **📊 Check Balance**: View current account balance
- **🛡️ PIN Authentication**: Simulated security verification
- **✅ Input Validation**: Robust error handling for user inputs
- **💫 Session Management**: Persistent menu until explicit exit
